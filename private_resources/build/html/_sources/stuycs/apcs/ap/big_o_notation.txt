Brief Overview
--------------
When comparing the performance of different algorithms, one of the most important concept to understand is
**Big O Notation**.

Mathematical Context
--------------------
In this section, we will take a more mathematical approach to explaining the behavior of Big O Notation.
Let's take a look at a few equations:

.. math::

   y &= 5x + 2 \\
   y &= 6x + 3 \\
   y &= x + 2 \\
   y &= x^2 + 4x + 9

**Exercise:** Categorize each of the equation above (logarithmic, quadratic, cubic, linear, etc...) and explain
your reasoning.

We can all agree that the first three equations are linear. Now suppose we were to superimpose the last equation
on top of the graph of the other equations and zoom out such that the x and y values are very large.
You would notice that for any value of x after a certain point would always yield a larger y value.  No matter
how steep we make our linear equations, they can never match the growth of a quadratic equation.

.. note::
   If you are ever confused about why we are ignoring the coefficients, think back to why you categorize the
   first three as linear equations.
